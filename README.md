# data-structures

This headerfile is created in order to simplify data structures operations in C language.

In language like c++ and java, they have predefined data structures like STL where you can use directly.

This headerfile allows you to use the data structures without caring what is happening inside.

To use this dsa header you need to download the headerfile and include it by using #include "path_to_the_file/dsa.h"
	
Include it in your C program and directly use data structures that are available in the header

for knowing how to use the functions refer to demo folder that is provided.
